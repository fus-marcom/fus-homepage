# fus-static-template


This template uses ES2015 (ES6) in app.js. In particular `let` is used instead of `var` please use Babel to transpile this for better browser compatability. If you prefer not to use ES2015, just change `let` to `var`.

Also included are polyfills for Fetch and Promises. These can be removed if not needed.
